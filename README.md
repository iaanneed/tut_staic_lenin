An interactive map of Lenin monuments in Belarus.

## About the Project

A simple web map showing Lenin monuments across Belarus. Built with MapLibre GL JS. Not a Lenin fan, just thought it would be fun to collect them since there are so many monuments in Belarus.

Think of it less as a complete, official database and more as a personal project created for fun. All photos and data were collected by us!
